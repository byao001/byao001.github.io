# Linux Signals
------------
This is my reading notes of the Chapter 20 in the book "The Linux Programming Interface".

## Concepts and Overview
------------
A signal is a notification to a process that an event has occured.

In the following cases, the kernel will generate a signal for a process:

* A hardware exception occured. Examples: executing a malformed instruction, divided by 0, referencing a part of memory that is inaccessible.
* The user typed one of the terminal special characters that generate signals, i.e. Ctrl-C, Ctrl-D.
* A software event occured. Examples: input available on a file descriptor, a timer went off, the process's CPU time exceed limits, a child process terminated.

Each signal is defined as a unique integer, starting sequentially from 1. These integers have symbolic names of the form *SIGxxxx*.

## Signal Dispositions
------------------
A Program can set one of the following  dispositions for a signal:

* *defualt action*. This can be used to undo an earlier change of the disposition.
* *ignore*
* *signal handler* is executed.

Signal Dispositions can be changed using systems *signal()* or *sigaction()*.

{% highlight c %}
#include <signal.h>
void (*signal(int sig, void (*handler)(int))) (int);
{% endhighlight %}

To make the prototype more comprehensible:

```C
typedef void (*sighandler_t)(int);
sighandler_t signal(int sig, sighandler_t handler);
```

Signal delivery and handler execution:

![figure-20-1]({{site.url}}/assets/figure-20-1.png)

The *singal handler* argument of *signal()*, can be the address of a function as *handler*, or the following values:

* SIG_DFL: Reset the disposition of the signal to its default.
* SIG_IGN: Ignore the signal. If the signal is generated for the process, the kernel silently discards it. The process never even knows that the signal occured.


Example of using *signal()*:

{% highlight c %}
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <signal.h>

static void sig_handler(int sig) {
  static int count = 0;
  if (sig == SIGINT) {
    count += 1;
    // unsafe using non-async-signal-safe functions
    printf(" Cought SIGINT (%d) \n", count);

    // return from the handler, but not exit the program
    return;
  }

  printf(" Cought SIGQUIT - that's all folks!\n");
  
  // unsafe using non-async-signal-safe functions
  // exit the whole program.
  exit(EXIT_SUCCESS);
}

void err_exit(const char *msg) {
  perror(msg);
  exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
}

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
  if (signal(SIGINT, sig_handler) == SIG_ERR)
    errExit("signal");
  if (signal(SIGQUIT, sig_handler) == SIG_ERR)
    errExit("signal");

  for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) {
    pause();
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

Following are the results of running the program twice. In the first time, only Ctrl-C is hit, while in the second time, Ctrl-\ was hit after Ctrl-C was hit three times:

{% highlight shell %}
$ gcc -o intquit intquit.c
$ ./intquit
^C Cought SIGINT (1)
^C Cought SIGINT (2)
^C Cought SIGINT (3)
^C Cought SIGINT (4)
^C Cought SIGINT (5)
^C Cought SIGINT (6)
^C Cought SIGINT (7)
^C Cought SIGINT (8)
^C Cought SIGINT (9)
^C Cought SIGINT (10)
$ ./intquit
^C Cought SIGINT (1)
^C Cought SIGINT (2)
^C Cought SIGINT (3)
^\ Cought SIGQUIT - that's all folks!
{% endhighlight %}
