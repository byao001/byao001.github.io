Kernel has *buffer caches*, read(), write() simply copy data between a user space buffer and a buffer in the kernel *buffer cache*.

The Linux kernel impose no fixed upper limit on the size of the buffer cache.

From kernel 2.4 onward, Linux no longer maintains a separate buffer cache. Instead, file I/O buffers are included in the page cache.

When use read() and write(), it is prefered to use a big buffer, then send a large amount of data in once.

<br />
## The **stdio** Library
----------------------
The ***stdio*** library buffers data into large blocks to reduce system calls, so users don't have to
write any buffer code explicitly.

The following function let user specity the *buffer* that the *stream* will use.
{% highlight c%}
#include <stdio.h>
int setvbuf(FILE *stream, char *buf, int mode, size_t s);
{% endhighlight %}

The *mode* argument can be on of the following value:

* `_IONBF`: Dont't buffer
* `_IOLBF`: Employ line-buffered I/O. Default for streams referring to terminal devices.
* `_IOFBF`: Employ fully buffered I/O. Default for streams referring to disk files.

The following functions are variant of the **setvbuf()**.
{% highlight c%}
#include <stdio.h>
void setbuf(File *stream, char *buf); // Use default BUFSIZE as buffer size.
void setbuffer(File *stream, char *buf, size_t size);
{% endhighlight %}

The `int fflush(FILE *stream)` function flushes the output buffer for specified *stream*. If the *stream* is `NULL`, *fflush* flushed all *stdio* buffers. If the *stream* is an input stream, the buffered input will be discarded.

<br />
## Control Kernel Buffering of File I/O
---------------------------------
*synchronized I/O data integrity data completion* : (file data) </br>
*synchronized I/O file integrity file completion* : (file data, file metadata)

{% highlight c%}
#include <unistd.h>
int fsync(int fd);     /* flush associated file data and metadata */
int fdatasync(int fd); /* flush associated file data */
void sync(void);       /* flush all the kernel buffers that contains updated data */
{% endhighlight %}

Open file flags, used in `open()` (i.e. `fd = open(pathname, O_WRONLY | O_SYNC)`) :

* O_SYNC : flushes *file data* and *metadata* for every write(). (*file integrity*)
* O_DSYNC : flushed *file data* for every write(). (*data integrity*)
* O_RSYNC : in conjunctionwith O_SYNC or O_DSYNC. if with O_DSYNC, pending writes must finish first according to *synchronized I/O data integrity data completion*. Otherwise, with O_SYNC, pending writes must finish first according to *synchronized I/O file integrity file completion*.

## Advising the kernel About I/O Patterns
---------------------------------
{% highlight c%}
#include <fcntl.h>
int posix_fadvise(int fd, off_t offset, off_t len, int advice);
{% endhighlight %}

*advice* has following possible values:

* `POSIX_FADV_NORMAL` : default, read-ahead window size set to default size(128KB).
* `POSIX_FADV_SEQUENTIAL` : expect read data sequentially from lower offset to hight offset, set read-ahead window size to twice the default size.
* `POSIX_FADV_WILLNEED` : read-ahead specified range of data to buffer cache, so the next `read()` on the range of data won't block on disk I/O. But no guarantees about how long the data will stay in the buffer cache, so try to call `read()` immediatily after calling `posix_fadvise()`.
* `POSIX_FADV_DONTNEED` : If no queued `write()` operations, flush all the modified pages in the specified region, then the kernel attempts to free any cache pages for the region. To ensure cache pages can be freed, call `sync()` or `fdatasync()` first.
* `POSIX_FADV_NOREUSE` : Tell kernel that it can free the pages after they haved been accessed once. *Not sure whether this hint has any effect on Linux or not.*

<br />
## Bypassing the Buffer Cache: Direct I/O
--------------------------------------
Open file with flag `O_DIRECT`, then the application could bypass the buffer cache when performing disk I/O. But in the most case, this will degrade performance, because lost of the kernel optimization including seqeuntial look-ahead, performing I/O in clusters of disk blocks, and allowing processed acceessing the same file to share buffers in cache.

When use direct I/O, there are a few alignment restrictions:

* The data buffer being transferred must be aligned on a memory boundary that is a multiple of the block size.
* File or device offset must be multiple of the block size.
* The length of data must be multiple of the block size.

<br />
## Mixing Library Functions and System Calls for File I/O
------------------------------------
To use *stdio* functions, applications have to use FILE* stream, while to use system calls, applications have to use int file descriptor. 

Since *stdio* library use data buffer to reduce the number of times of data copying between user space and kernel space, while system calls copy data from user space buffer to kernel buffer directly. When mxing the library functions and system calls for file I/O, applications need to be careful about the actual sequence of writing data to file. 

One way is to use `fflush()` after *stdio* libary function calls, which may reduce performance.

{% highlight c%}
#include <stdio.h>
int fileno(FILE *stream);
FILE *fdopen(int fd, const char *mode);
{% endhighlight %}

When writing data to **socket** or **pipes**, `fdopen()` is very useful. First use `fdopen()` to create a file stream, then use *stdio* library functions to write data, applications don't have to use system call deirectly every time it need to read or write data.
